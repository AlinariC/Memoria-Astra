# About the Author

*Alinari Campbell* is a visionary science fiction author whose work blends cosmology, mythology, and speculative evolution. With the *Memoria Astra* series, Campbell invites readers into a grand, multi-volume odyssey exploring the birth, death, and rebirth of universesâ€”woven together by harmonic memory, celestial echoes, and the eternal pulse of life itself.

    When not chronicling the spirals of existence, Alinari enjoys working with emerging technology, exploring new realms of storytelling, and engaging in thought experiments that blur the line between science and wonder. Each book in the *Memoria Astra* saga builds upon a universe both ancient and new, inviting readers to question the nature of time, identity, and purpose.
