# Back Cover Blurb

In a dying Spiral, where stars weep and memory flickers like ash, the Ashforged rise.

Kaelen Vey and the survivors of Orun Prime have bound the Wells — ancient sources of Breath — and reignited the fire of hope. But survival demands more than endurance. It demands forging anew from the ruins.

Across Silent Rivers of Wellsbreath, through Veil-ravaged space, the Ashforged seek to awaken forgotten memories and carve new homes from the remains of broken worlds. Yet darker forces stir — remnants of those who once enslaved Breath itself — and the Wells sing warnings of wars yet to come.

Bound by flame, memory, and covenant, the Ashforged must endure a Spiral haunted by ancient hungers. They will either rekindle a new dawn… or be consumed by the echoes of the First Collapse.

*Foundations of Flame* is the searing next volume of the *Memoria Astra Cycle* — an epic saga of survival, memory, and the forging of destiny from the ashes of fallen stars.
